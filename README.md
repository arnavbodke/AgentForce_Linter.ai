Think of Linter.ai as a helpful senior developer who's always available to review your pull requests on GitHub and GitLab. It uses a team of specialized AI agents like a security expert and a performance specialist to catch a wide range of issues, from critical security flaws to simple style mistakes.

The feedback is always practical, it tells you how severe each issue is, explains the problem clearly, and gives you the exact code snippet to fix it. To save you time, Linter.ai even provides the complete, corrected version of your file, so you can apply all the fixes in one go.
